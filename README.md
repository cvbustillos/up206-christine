## About Me

Hi y'all! My name is Christine (she/her) and I'm a second year MURP concentrating in design and development. I grew up in Glendale, CA and have lived most of my life in the LA area. Prior to grad school, I worked for LA City Planning mostly doing entitlement processing and a bit of community planning. My academic interests include affordable housing, alternative housing models (CLTs, coops, etc), gentrification and displacement, land use, and environmental justice. Outside of school, I love hiking & spending time outside, petting dogs, and exploring LA.

## Course Description & Objectives 
I'm new to both coding and GIS, and in this course I hope to gain a foundational understanding of coding, spatial analysis, and data visualization. I'm also hoping to learn more about data analysis and ways to use spatial data science to advance racial justice in urban planning.

## Project Ideas
My capstone project is about limited-equity housing coops & CLTs, so I'm interested in doing a project related to those topics, gentrification & displacement in LA, and/or racial segregation and inequities.
